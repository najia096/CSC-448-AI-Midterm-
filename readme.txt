This repo has two files- a pdf report about Strong Ai vs Weak Ai and a simple machine learning model code.

The report covers key aspects like characteristics, status, potential applications, and mathematical approaches for both paradigms.


This code uses mathematical approach like neural networks (embedding, LSTM, and linear layers) and optimization tricks to learn things. 

It's kind of like what they do in Weak AI and Strong AI where computers learn tasks. 


But, just so you know, Strong AI needs even fancier math to be as smart as humans â€“ like, super complex brainy stuff!
